        });
    }

    async initialize() {
        this.subscribe('window:open', () => this.resetIdleTimer());
        this.addHandler(document, 'mousemove', () => this.onUserActivity());
        this.startIdleMonitoring();

### Design Patterns

**Event-Driven Architecture**
```javascript
// 200+ semantic events for everything that happens in the OS
import EventBus, { Events, Priority } from './core/SemanticEventBus.js';

// Subscribe with priority control
EventBus.on(Events.WINDOW_OPEN, (payload, metadata, event) => {
    console.log(`Window opened: ${payload.id}`);
}, { priority: Priority.NORMAL });

// Pattern matching (wildcards)
EventBus.on('window:*', handler);  // All window events
EventBus.on('app:*', handler);     // All app events

// Request/response for async operations
const result = await EventBus.request('dialog:confirm', { message: 'OK?' });

// Throttled emissions for high-frequency events
EventBus.emitThrottled(Events.MOUSE_MOVE, { x, y }, 16);
```

**Singleton Pattern**
```javascript
// Single instances for core services
const StateManager = new StateManagerClass();
export default StateManager;
```

**Observer Pattern**
```javascript
// Reactive state subscriptions
StateManager.subscribe('windows', (windows) => {
    TaskbarRenderer.update(windows);
});
```

**Base Class Pattern**
```javascript
// Consistent app interface with multi-instance support
class MyApp extends AppBase {
    onOpen() { return '<div>App content</div>'; }
    onMount() { /* setup event listeners */ }
    onClose() { /* cleanup */ }
}
```

### Data Flow

```
User Action
    ↓
UI Renderer (captures event)
    ↓
EventBus (broadcasts event)
    ↓
Handlers (process event)
    ↓
StateManager (updates state)
    ↓
StorageManager (persists to localStorage)
    ↓
Subscribers (react to state changes)
    ↓
UI Updates
```

## Configuration

### Settings

Settings are stored in localStorage and can be modified via Control Panel:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `sound` | `false` | Enable/disable sound effects |
| `crtEffect` | `true` | Enable/disable CRT scanline overlay |
| `pet.enabled` | `false` | Show/hide desktop pet |
| `pet.type` | `🐕` | Current pet emoji |
| `screensaverDelay` | `300000` | Screensaver delay (ms) |

### LocalStorage Keys

IlluminatOS! uses the prefix `illuminatos_` for all stored data:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `smos_desktopIcons` | Icon positions |
| `smos_achievements` | Unlocked achievements |
| `smos_snakeHigh` | Snake high score |
| `smos_soundEnabled` | Sound preference |
| `smos_crtEnabled` | CRT effect preference |
| `smos_petEnabled` | Pet visibility |
| `smos_currentPet` | Selected pet type |
| `smos_fileSystem` | Virtual file system data |
| `smos_recycledItems` | Recycle bin contents |
| `smos_adminPassword` | Admin panel password |

### Clearing Data

To reset IlluminatOS! to default state:

```javascript
// In browser console
Object.keys(localStorage)
    .filter(key => key.startsWith('smos_'))
    .forEach(key => localStorage.removeItem(key));
location.reload();
```

Or use the Terminal:
```
reset --factory
```

Or use Control Panel > Advanced > Reset

## Development

For detailed information on creating new applications, see the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

### Quick Start: Adding New Applications

1. Create a new file in `/apps/`:

```javascript
// apps/MyApp.js
import AppBase from './AppBase.js';

class MyApp extends AppBase {
    constructor() {
        super({
            id: 'myapp',
            name: 'My Application',
            icon: 'fa-solid fa-star', // FontAwesome class or emoji
            width: 400,
            height: 300,
            resizable: true,
            singleton: false,
            category: 'accessories'
        });
    }

    onOpen() {
        return `
            <div class="myapp-container">
                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            </div>
        `;
    }

    onMount() {
        // Setup event listeners after DOM is ready
        // Use this.addHandler() for automatic cleanup
    }

    onClose() {
        // Cleanup when window closes
    }
}

export default MyApp;
```

2. Register in `AppRegistry.js`:

```javascript
import MyApp from './MyApp.js';
AppRegistry.register(new MyApp(), {
    category: 'accessories',
    description: 'My custom application'
});
```

## Event System

IlluminatOS! features a comprehensive event system with 200+ semantic events organized into namespaces. Every action in the OS emits events that can be observed and scripted.

### Event Namespaces

| Namespace | Events | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `window` | 18 | Window lifecycle (create, open, close, focus, resize, move, snap, etc.) |
| `app` | 12 | App lifecycle (launch, ready, close, focus, blur, state, messaging) |
| `system` | 18 | System events (boot, ready, idle, sleep, wake, network, fullscreen) |
| `mouse` | 10 | Mouse input (move, click, dblclick, down, up, scroll, contextmenu) |
| `keyboard` | 5 | Keyboard input (keydown, keyup, combo, shortcut, input) |
| `touch` | 4 | Touch input (start, move, end, cancel) |
| `gesture` | 6 | Gesture detection (tap, doubletap, swipe, pinch, rotate, longpress) |
| `fs` | 12 | File system (create, read, update, delete, rename, move, copy) |
| `feature` | 5 | Feature lifecycle (initialize, ready, enable, disable, config) |
| `perf` | 5 | Performance (fps, memory, longtask, measure) |
| `audio` | 8 | Audio playback (play, pause, resume, stop, ended, error) |
| `ui` | 7 | UI interactions (menu, taskbar, context menu) |
| `dialog` | 8 | System dialogs (alert, confirm, prompt, file dialogs) |

See [SEMANTIC_EVENTS.md](SEMANTIC_EVENTS.md) for complete documentation.

### Quick Example

```javascript
import EventBus, { Events, Priority } from './core/SemanticEventBus.js';

// Listen to all file system events
EventBus.on('fs:*', (payload, metadata) => {
    console.log(`File operation: ${metadata.name}`, payload);
});

// Listen to specific events with priority
EventBus.on(Events.APP_LAUNCH, (payload) => {
    console.log(`App launched: ${payload.appId}`);
}, { priority: Priority.SCRIPT });

// Wait for an event
const { payload } = await EventBus.waitFor(Events.SYSTEM_READY);

// Use channels for scoped communication
const channel = EventBus.channel('my-channel', 'subscriber-1');
channel.send({ message: 'Hello!' });
channel.receive((msg, sender) => console.log(`From ${sender}:`, msg));
```
